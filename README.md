# Country of the Day - I-Learn 3.0 Widget

Just grab the JavaScript file and attach it to a script tag in the HTML.  The used file will be sourced from Equella, the CMS of BYU-Idaho.  So that the content appears, make a div tag with the id attribute as "countryDayWidget" like the following example.  

    <div id="countryDayWidget"></div>
    <script src="https://content.byui.edu/integ/gen/316e5ad6-51c9-483a-8ca5-dc1e077671fe/0/countries.js"></script>

This will generate a page with the country of the day flag and its style all dynamically made by the JavaScript file.
